TCA - Magic: The Gathering Companion App

MTG Companion App designed in the Front End Web Development class. A web/mobile application meant to be used alongside a game of Magic: The Gathering.
This application enhances the gameplay experience through the tracking of game flow and user statistics. Features include;

- In-Game tracking of mana curve, life lost/gained, and eventually more?
- Deck editing allowing users to track decks used/played against
- Individual user statistics showing win/loss record, vs. record, and decks used.

Throughout app development, I will be updating with burn-up charts and commentary. This application will be developed organically, and is thus 
susceptible to change throughout the semester.

UPDATE February 16th, 2021
